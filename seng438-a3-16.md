# 1 Introduction

# 1. Introduction

This lab introduces of understanding Whitebox testing and coverage methods involving control flow and data flow coverage. It also allows us to familiarize ourselves with coverage tools like EclEmma, and coverage metrics, like statement, branch, and method coverage.

Our group is meant to use the Blackbox unit tests written in assignment 2 and apply Whitebox testing and coverage techniques to improve them. 
For Section 3.1, we evaluated our previous unit tests from assignment 2 against three metrics: line, branch, and method coverage. 
For Section 3.2, we manually measured data flow coverage by creating Data Flow Graphs for two methods and determined the definitions, uses, DU-pairs, and DU-pair coverage present in the methods.
For Section 3.3, we updated our existing unit tests ad added newones to further improve their coverage against the three chosen metrics.

Our initial knowledge of Whitebox testing came from content covered in lectures. The lectures explained that Whitebox testing focuses on creating tests based on knowledge of the internal structure and code of the system. We can develop Whitebox tests to satisfy coverage criterias. For Control Flow Coverage, metrics to evaluate could be statement, branch, condition, MC/DC, and path coverage. For Data Flow Coverage, metrics to evaluate could be All-Definitions, All-Uses, and All-DU Paths coverage. These coverage criteria can help in the development and improvement of unit tests. By satisfying different coverage criteria and ensuring the execution of different paths in the program, we can reduce bugs in our system.

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

### DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal -> 20 DU-pairs
### Range.contains -> 3 DU-pairs

Data Flow Graphs for contains and calculateColumnTotal can be found in the Part 3.2 Folder.

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

Testing Strategy:
- Look at our existing unit tests and improve their statement, branch, and method coverage.
- Look at existing values of coverage metrics, analyze source code, and create test cases which cover missed statements, branches, and methods.

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report
## EclEmma
### Pros of EclEmma: 
- Easy to use
- Built in to eclipse
- Has useful coverage metrics

### Cons EclEmma:
- No condition coverage
- Only works with Eclipse

## Metrics:
1. Statement Coverage 
    - Pros: Identifies executed code.
    - Cons: Doesn't guarantee logical correctness.
2. Branch Coverage 
    - Pros: Identifies paths not taken.
    - Cons: Doesn't guarantee branch condition correctness.
3. Method Coverage 
    - Pros: Ensures all methods are tested.
    - Cons: Doesn't ensure method perform properly in all scenarios.

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.
## Requirements-Based 
### Advantages:
- **Matches Stakeholder Expectations**: Software will meet the intended functionality as defined by stakeholders
- **Traceability**: Clear traceability between the tests and the specified requirements
- **Black-Box Testing**: Do not need to know internals of the source code to develop tests
### Disadvantages:
- **Incomplete Requirements**: If the requirements are incomplete or ambiguous, we may miss critical scenarios.
- **Limited Coverage**: May not cover all possible scenarios, leading to potential gaps in test coverage.
- **No Feedback**: lack of confirmation in regards to the extensiveness of the tests

## Coverage-Based
### Advantages:
- **Objective Metrics**: Statement, branch, and method coverages help in identifying areas of the code that have not been tested by giving a tangible percentage
- **Thouroughness**: Error checking is more extensive, and unit tests are more targeted at specific requirements
- **Adaptability**: Not dependent on specific requirements. More adaptable to changes in the source code without requiring large modifications to the test suite
### Disadvantages:
- **White-Box Testing**: Requires knowledge of source code internals
- **Technical Requirements not guaranteed**: Full coverage does not guarantee all technical requirements have been met  
- **Time Cost**: Amount of time required to reach full coverage on large projects may be very long

# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

We all collaborated in a VSCode Liveshare session while discussing in a voice call.
We also all completed the report together, in person.
Test case creation and coverage analysis was performed as a group.

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab
- Coverage results outputted by EclLemma were sometimes difficult to interpret. We had to figure out how to read the coverage metrics properly and understand what they meant.
- We also had some difficulties figuring out how to achieve better coverage from our test cases. We needed to analyze the source code and figure what statements and branches needed better coverage. 
- We learned the importance of adding to our test suite using Whitebox testing methods. We also learned how to use coverage metrics to evaluate and improve our test suite.

# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

- Since this lab comes around midterms, it would be amazing if this lab had a length of 3 weeks instead of 2 to account for this. 
- It would also be great if all necessary JAR files are already included in the artifacts for this assignment instead of needing to go back to assignment 2 and figure out which ones are missing. Specifically, ```hamcrest-library-1.1.jar```.
